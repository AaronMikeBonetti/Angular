        <h1>Decorator Overview</h1>
    <p>Decorators provide configuration metadata that determines how the class (component, service, module), method, property or parameter should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime.
        A decorator takes another function or data and extends or changes the behavior of that function without explicitly modifying the original data or function.
        An example of this is the class pipe decorator, the uppercase pipe takes in a value and makes the string uppercase without modifying the actual data.
        <br>
        <span>Example : {{'uppercase' | uppercase}}</span>
    </p>
    <h3>There are 5 main types of decorators
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Component</li>
        <li>Parameter</li>
        <li>Property</li>
        <li>Method</li>
        <li>Custom</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

        <h2>Class</h2>
        <p>Tells us about a particular classâ€™s intent and helps answer questions like whether the class is a component, service or a module.
            <br>
            <span>Example: The @Component decorator marks a class as an Angular component and provides configuration
                metadata that determines how the component should be processed, instantiated, and used at runtime, same with @Injectable for services.
            </span>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Parameter</h2>
        <p> 
            Allows you to manually tell Angular to inject a particular provider. a provider is just an object that tells the class how to inject the dependency.
            It can also be used to do something with a parameter in a method ie : function doSomething(@ValidateParameter data).
            Then just create a function that looks like this: function ValidateParameter(target:any, propertyKey:any, propertyIndex:any). 
            This Allows you to configure the data that is being fed to the function before it uses it.
            <br>
            <span>Example: @Inject is used to provide a custom provider to the class to use a dependency</span>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Property</h2>
        <p>This is used to decorate specific properties or variables inside a class.
            <br>
            <span>Example: The @Input and @Output Decorator allows a component to exchange data between itself and either
            its child component or parent component
            </span>
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>@Input</h3>
            <p>The @Input decorator allows us to update data from the parent to the child component</p>
            <h3>@Output</h3>
            <p>The @Output decorator allows us to update data from the child to parent component</p>
            <br>
            <span>Counter from Child: {{propertyCounter}}</span>
            <app-decorator-lesson-child [parentToChildDecorator] ="parentToChildDecorator" (childEventData)="childToParentDecoratorEvent($event)"></app-decorator-lesson-child>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Method</h2>
        <p>Similar to property decorators but are used for methods instead. method decorators are used to modify or enhance the behavior of class methods.
            <br>
            <span>Example: @HostListener is used to listen to events on the host element of a component or directive. 
                You can use it to bind methods to specific events such as clicks, keypresses ect.
            </span>
        </p>
        <section>
            <h3>@HostListener</h3>
            <h4>When you press a key, angular listens and the count will go up</h4>
            <h4 *ngIf="methodCounter !== 1">You have pressed {{methodCounter}} keys!</h4>
            <h4 *ngIf="methodCounter === 1">You have pressed {{methodCounter}} key!</h4>
            <h4 *ngIf="lastKeyPressed">You have pressed the '{{lastKeyPressed}}' key</h4>
            <h4 *ngIf="!lastKeyPressed">No key was pressed yet!</h4>
            <button class="reset-button" (click)="resetCounter()">Reset Counter</button>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Custom</h2>
        <p>The last decorator type is a custom decorator is typically a TypeScript function that takes one or more arguments 
            and is used to annotate a class, method, property, or parameter with some additional functionality.
